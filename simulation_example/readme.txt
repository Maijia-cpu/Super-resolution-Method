This folder shows an example of how estimated radius is obtained.
Ground truth of the model image used in simulations is : radius 72nm.

Each subfolder with name "1" to "6" contains results for each simulation.
Mean radii of simulations: average of last 200 steps (unit:nm, number corresponds to subfolder name)
1. 79.47;
2. 73.28;
3. 68.87;
4. 78.05;
5. 75.59;
6. 67.92;

The estimated radius is: 73.9±4.7 nm (mean±SD, N=6).
